### Project 3 : Investigate a Dataset (TMDB Database)

### Project Overview
In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

Data wrangling and EDA were made on the dataset, therefore five questions were answered through analysing this dataset:
* Movie that had the most runtime and least?

## Project 1: Explore Weather Trends

## Project Overview

This first project required the following steps:
* Extract data from a database using a SQL query
* Calculate a moving average
* Create a line chart 

In this project I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trend in Mecca City to overall global temperature trends.
This was done by first, extracting the required data which was the temperature data for the world as well as for Mecca city using SQL. 
Then creatig 3 line charts (  global average tempreture, Mecca city average tempreture, Mecca vs global average tempreture).

### Observations

* The global average temperature varies between 7.65 to 9.51 degrees, but Mecca city average temperature varies between 22.46 to 27.05 degrees.
* There is a big difference between Mecca city chart and the global chart because when comparing both of them, it shows that the mecca city is hotter than Global average temperature.
* When choosing a short range like 10 or 20, the lines will be messy in the chart, which means that Why I found the range of 140 to be ideal is because the lines in the chart are relatively smooth.
* In the global chart, it shows that the temperature increases over the years.
* In both the city chart and the global chart, it shows that the maximumtemperature from 1915 to 1945 is 1945 that is 27.05 degree for city chart and 9.51 for theÂ global chart.

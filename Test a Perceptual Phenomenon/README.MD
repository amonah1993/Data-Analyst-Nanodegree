### Project 5: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon

### Project Overview
In this project, you will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. You will learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task yourself. You will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, you will interpret your results in terms of your hypotheses.

### Through this project, 5 questions will be answered:

* What is the independent variable? What is the dependent variable?

independent variable:Congruent or Incongruent condition dependent variable: How much time to complete the test (Response time)

* What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? Specify your null and alternative hypotheses, and clearly define any notation used.

Null Hypothesis: the Congruent condition has no significant difference as much as the Incongruent condition ( no time difference between Incongruent and Congruent) Alternative Hypothesis: the Incongruent condition has a significant difference compared to Congruent condition (Incongruent take more time than Congruent)

μd is mean difference H0:μd=0 H1:μd!=0

The appropriate statistical test for this task is t-test because there are two different conditions that has been assigned to the same subject and those conditions is dependent and by so a mean between them must be compared to conclude the statistically significant difference also because the population standard deviations is unknown

* Report some descriptive statistics regarding this dataset. Include at least one measure of central tendency and at least one measure of variability.

This was answered by showing the mean and sd for both Congruent and Inongruent.

* Provide one or two visualizations that show the distribution of the sample data. Write one or two sentences noting what you observe about the plot or plots.

* What is your confidence level or Type I error associated with your test? What is your conclusion regarding the hypotheses you set up? Did the results match up with your expectations? 

tc=24-1=23 
Confidence level is 90% and the probability is 0.05 
t-critical is 1.714 
(8.020>1.714) The null hypothesis is rejected becuase there is no significant differences in the response time for the two different conditions ( no time difference between Incongruent and Congruent) as it has been expected above that the Incongruent condition has a significant difference compared to Congruent condition (Incongruent take more time than Congruent)
